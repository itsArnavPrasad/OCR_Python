# Optical Character Recognition with Python! <font color="#4CAF50">85% Accuracy</font><br>
This project implements an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system using Python and fundamental libraries like NumPy and Pandas.<br>

<h3>Project Overview</h3>
This project builds a machine learning model to recognize characters from a 24x24 pixel image dataset.<br><br>

Libraries: Python (core), NumPy, Pandas<br>
Model Architecture: Multi-layer Perceptron with ReLU and Softmax Activation Functions<br>
Accuracy: Achieves an impressive 85% accuracy on testing data<br>
